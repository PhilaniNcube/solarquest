          <p>
            This website (Solarquest) knows that you care how information about
            you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do
            so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy.
            By visiting Solarquest’s website, you are accepting the practices
            described in this Privacy Notice.

            Personal Customer Information Gathered by Solarquest.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-1">
            The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and
            continually improve your shopping experience at Solarquest. Here are
            the types of information we gather.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-1">
            <strong>Information you give us: </strong>
            We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or
            give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain
            information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of
            many of our features. We use the information that you provide for
            such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future
            shopping for you, improving our store, and communicating with you.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-1">
            <strong>Automatic Information: </strong>
            We receive and store certain types of information whenever you
            interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use
            “cookies”, and we obtain certain types of information when your Web
            browser accesses this website. A number of companies offer utilities
            designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will
            not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at
            Solarquest if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that
            these tools exist.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-1">
            <strong>Information from Other Sources: </strong>
            To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we may receive
            a confirmation when you open e-mail from Solarquest if your computer
            supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to
            lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending
            unnecessary messages to our customers.
          </p>{" "}
          <h3 className="mt-4 text-lg font-bold">Cookies</h3>
          <p className="mt-1">
            Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your
            computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems
            to recognize your browser.

            The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how

            browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable
            cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full
            advantage of some of this websites’s best features, and we recommend
            that you leave them turned on.

            Sharing of information received by Solarquest
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-1">
            Information about our customers is an important part of our
            business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We
            share customer information only with the subsidiaries of Solarquest
            as described below.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-1">
            <strong>Agents: </strong>
            We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on
            our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages,
            sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from
            customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,
            processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.
            They have access to personal information needed to perform their
            functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-1">
            <strong>Promotional Offers: </strong>
            We might, at some stage in the future, send offers to selected
            groups of Solarquest customers on behalf of other businesses. When
            we do this, we do not give that business your name and address.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-1">
            <strong>Business Transfers: </strong>
            As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores
            or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is
            one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event
            that Solarquest, or substantially all of its assets are acquired,
            customer information will of course be one of the transferred
            assets.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-1">
            <strong>Protection of Solarquest and Others: </strong>
            We release account and other personal information when we believe
            release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our
            Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights,
            property, or safety of Solarquest, our users, or others. This
            includes exchanging information with other companies and
            organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-1">
            With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive
            notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you
            will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
          </p>{" "}

            Security of Your Information
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-1">
            We work to protect the security of your information during
            transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which
            encrypts information you input.
          </p>

            As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide

            take advantage of this websites features.
